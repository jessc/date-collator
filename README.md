# Date Collator

Date Collator is a Lua script built for the iOS app [Trunk Notes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trunk-notes/id302880785).

Opens a specific file with dates (e.g. from a daylog) on each line.

Uses current date (month and day), collates all the lines into one file, displays this text.


## Installation

Create new file in Trunk Notes. (todo: certain name?)

Copy code from script, then paste it in the file.

Put (tentative, but something like):
{{lua date_collator, (filename), (array_of_years), (current_month_and_day)}}
in another file that will show the text when you visit that page.
